# dissent

This will be a tabletop-RPG about activists fighting the good fight. You signed the online partitions, you went to the demonstrations but now is enough. In a world with mass surveillance, a wide gap between the poor and the ultra-rich, you are a group of people who had enough. 

The game will be based on the Apocalypse Engine. More to come.
